# DailyUI 100 Days of Design Challenges

This is part of my journey to become a more proficient Web Designer.

[DailyUI](https://www.dailyui.co/) is a site that has a challenge to help people become better Web Designers. The challenge is **100 Days of Design** in which they'll email a challenge to you every day.

Complete these challenges on a daily basis and after 100 days you'll be a better Web Designer.

This entire repo will store each of the challenges in its own directory prefixed with the challenge number like `1_sign-up-page`.

Instead of creating 100 separate repos for relatively small projects it seemed more appropriate to have one repo. This way I have all of my challenges in one place as well and can better see what I've done in the past and how I'm improving!

Happy coding/designing!
